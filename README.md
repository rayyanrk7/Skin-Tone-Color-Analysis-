# Skin-Tone-Color-Analysis
This project uses computer vision to analyze a user's skin tone via webcam and recommend clothing colors that match their undertone (warm, cool, or neutral).

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV (Haar Cascades + HSV processing)
- Real-time video feed analysis

## ðŸ’¡ Concept
Professional image consultants charge hundreds of dollars for color analysis. This tool provides a **free, real-time solution** using basic image processing and color theory to enhance personal fashion decisions.

## ðŸ“¸ Features
- Live face detection
- Skin tone classification using HSV hue analysis
- Real-time color suggestions based on undertone

## ðŸš€ Use Cases
- Personal styling
- Fashion e-commerce
- Virtual dressing room apps
- Style recommendation engines

## ðŸ§  Future Work
- Add GUI (Tkinter or PyQt)
- Expand to hair/eye color analysis
- Train on labeled datasets for more accuracy
